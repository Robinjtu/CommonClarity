    <h2 class="lead"><span class="teal-text lower">CommonClarity</span> transforms Common Core test data into <span class="teal-text">actionable insights</span> to inform instruction.</h2>
    <p>Data-driven instruction has grown in popularity with the rise of standardized testing. In many districts around the country, students take standardized tests nearly every other month. These tests generate a huge amount of data, which teachers are expected to utilize to inform instruction; however, they lack the time and the tools to make sense of it.</p>
    <h2 class="lead">That's where <span class="teal-text lower">CommonClarity</span> comes in.</h2>
    <p>CommonClarity makes it easy for teachers to upload their data and instantly generate a dashboard of reports, showing their students' strengths and weaknesses according to Common Core State Standards. Data are grouped in useful ways to expose patterns and track progress, so that teachers can better help students improve.</p>
    <h2>To view a sample dashboard, log in using <span class="teal-text lower">common(at)clarity(dot)com / password.</span></h2>
