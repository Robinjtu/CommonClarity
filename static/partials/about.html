    <h2 class="lead"><span class="teal-text">DATA DASH</span> transforms Common Core test data into <span class="teal-text">actionable insights</span> to inform instruction.</h2>
    <p class="lead">The importance of standardized test results in public schools has led many districts to require students to take pretests every few months to prepare. Teachers are <span class="teal-text">inundated with data</span> from these tests and lack the time needed to analyze it.</p>
    <h2 class="lead">That's where <span class="teal-text">DATA DASH</span> comes in.</h2>
    <p class="lead"><span class="teal-text">DATA DASH</span> makes it easy for teachers to upload their data and instantly generate <span class="teal-text">visual reports</span> of their students' strengths and weaknesses, according to the Common Core State Standards. Data are grouped in useful ways to <span class="teal-text">expose patterns and track progress</span>, so that teachers can target instruction and help students improve.</p>
