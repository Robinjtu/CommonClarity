CommonClarity
=============

CommonClarity transforms standardized test data into a visual, interactive reporting dashboard for teachers, to help inform and target instruction.

####The Project

Data-driven instruction has grown in popularity with the rise of standardized testing. In many districts around the country, students take standardized tests nearly every other month. These tests generate a huge amount of data, which teachers are expected to utilize to inform instruction; however, they lack the time and the tools to make sense of it.

CommonClarity makes it easy for teachers to upload their data and instantly generate a dashboard of reports, showing their students' strengths and weaknesses according to Common Core State Standards. Data are grouped in useful ways to expose patterns and track progress, so that teachers can better help students improve.

####Technologies Used

CommonClarity was written using AngularJS, D3, JavaScript, Python, Flask, HTML5, CSS3/Sass, jQuery, BeautifulSoup, SQLAlchemy, and Postgresql.

####How It Works

Teachers can quickly set up their classes of students in the system and easily import the CSV files of their test data. Those files are then parsed by matching student names and Common Core State Standards to the database and entering scores for each student according to each standard.

Reports are generated by aggregating the data across all classes, by individual class, and by individual student and generating an interactive dashboard. This dashboard shows teachers the following information:
 - 1) The top Common Core State Standards students are struggling with, and which students have not met each of those standards
 - 2) The students who are struggling the most and the percentage of standards each of those students has not met
 - 3) A high-level overview of student performance on the most recent test
 - 4) A detailed view of student performance, broken out by all tests and by Common Core State Standard
 - 5) Student performance on the most recent test, compared to the rest of the school and the district overall
 - 6) A list of the standards tested on the most recent test
 - 7) An individual class's performance on the most recent test, broken out by student
 - 8) Student improvement on the most recent test from the test prior

####Product Details

#####The Database

The Postgres database uses SQLAlchemy as its ORM and contains tables for users, cohorts, student cohorts, tests, Common Core State Standards, scores, and normed scores.

To seed the Common Core State Standards table, I scraped the standards from the CCSS website using Beautiful Soup and wrote the data into a CSV file. The data were cleaned using the script [parse.py](/data_cleaning/parse.py) and seeded into the database table using the script [standards_seed.py](/standards_seed.py).

The script [scores_seed.py](/scores_seed.py) was used to seed the tests and scores tables before the test upload function was built.

#####The RESTful API

The module [api.py](/api.py) contains the RESTful API for CommonClarity. Each function is called by a Flask route in app.py and, when called, queries the server, manipulates and aggregates the data, and converts the response into JSON to display on the front-end.

#####AngularJS and D3

CommonClarity is built as a single-page webapp using AngularJS for the front end. Flask is used to serve the initial template ([index.html](/templates/index.html)) and the other pages are in [partials](/static/partials). The routes and controllers are configured in [app.js](/static/js/app.js). The controllers in [controllers.js](/static/js/controllers.js) make calls to RESTful API endpoints and Angular directives are used to display the JSON.

Each report is drawn using D3 and a custom Angular directive [(directives.js)](/static/js/directives.js). Each graph is scaled according to the amount of data returned and features legends and tooltips.
